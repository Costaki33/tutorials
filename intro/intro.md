## Introduction

The Tapis framework is an application programming interface (API) hosted in the cloud.
Using Tapis, computational researchers can manage data and execute software on a
variety of different systems, including virtual machines (VMs) and high-performance
computing (HPC) clusters. This website is a collection of self-paces tutorials for learning
how to incorporate Tapis into computational research.

Programming a computational experiment with Tapis affords the following benefits:
* _Automation_ - Researchers can use Tapis to automatically run workloads on 
different machines and even across different institutions.
* _Portability_ - Tapis makes it easier to run the same application on different machines.
* _Repeatability and Reproducibility_ - Tapis records the inputs and parameters that were used to execute
software allowing researchers and their collaborators to repeat prior job runs and reproduce results.
* _Collaboration_ - Researchers can keep their data, applications and results private or they can share 
them with their collaborators.

## Prerequisites
These tutorials assume access to and familiarity with the following topics:
* Basic Unix shell commands
* Python programming language and writing Python code in a REPL or Jupyter notebook.
* Docker containers

Additionally, the tutorials assume the reader has access to the following: 
* A TACC account (sign up for a TACC account here: https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/account-request)
* A working computer with Unix (Linux, Mac OSX) 
* A recent version of Docker installed
